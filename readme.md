# Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP is a programming paradigm that organizes code around
objects rather than functions or procedures, allowing developers to create more structured, reusable, and maintainable applications. It is a core feature of PHP since version 5. 

## Class
A class in a template to create objects

## Objects
